# Game-of-Life
An implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). I created this project to practice [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To compile, go to the `src` directory and run `tsc`.

To run, compile the project, then open `game_of_life.html` in any web browser.
